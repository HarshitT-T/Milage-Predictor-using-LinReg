# Milage Prediction in Automobiles using Linear Regression

The mission is to predict the mileage of a particular car in city driving, given data of some parameters (features) for hundreds of cars.
   1. mpg:           continuous
   2. cylinders:     multi-valued discrete
   3. displacement:  continuous
   4. weight:        continuous
   5. acceleration:  continuous
   6. model year:    multi-valued discrete
   7. origin:        multi-valued discrete



## Deployment

Achieved an accuracy of 85%
